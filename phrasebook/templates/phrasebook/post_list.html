<p>Welcome! If you want to learn Finnish, this website will be useful for you.
The main example sentences will have audio which is important
for getting used to the pronounciation. Also hearing them many times will make them easier
to remember.</p>
<p> Here you can find
    <a href="{% url 'reverse_list' %}">common questions that Finnish people will ask you.</a>

</p>
<p>This site will also cover some conversational connectors.
They are explained well <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fluentczech/connectorstarterpack" target="_blank">at this website.</a>
But in short, conversational connnectors are very useful because
they make your sentences longer and more interesting. Also they give you more thinking time for the actual information
you want to convey to the other person. An example:</p>

    {% for post in posts %}
        <div class="post">
            <table border="1" style="width:100%">
                <tr>
                    <td>{{ post.connector|linebreaks }}</td>
                    <td>{{ post.contransl|linebreaks }}</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>{{ post.examplesent|linebreaks }}
                            <a onclick="this.firstChild.play()"><audio src="{{ post.audiofilulinkki }}"></audio>
                                <img src="/static/play.png"></a>
                    </td>
                    <td>{{ post.exampletransl|linebreaks }}</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2"> {{ post.usagenotes|linebreaks }}  </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}

<h3><a name="more">How to use (and how not to use) this website</a></h3>
<p>
For more or less serious students of Finnish, this website does not pretend to be a comprehensive language course.
There are many ways to get fluent in a language, but usually you need a combination of different methods and materials.
I will not, for example, teach much grammar here. There are many books and websites for that.
<p>
This website focuses more on conversation, the amazing world of human interaction.
</p>
<p>
    There are many ways that you can memorize the useful sentences that this website teaches.
    It's probably a good idea to say them out loud.
    You can write them down in your notes, and you can imagine different situations where you can use them.
    And most imporantly, use them in real life, in your conversations and messages.
    Language is a skill and we learn skills by doing (ie. talking and writing to people).
