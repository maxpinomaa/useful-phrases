    Conversational connectors are explained well <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fluentczech/connectorstarterpack" target="_blank">at this website</a>.
    But in short, they are very useful because they make your sentences longer,
    and often more interesting.
    Also they give you more thinking time for the actual information you want to convey to the other person.

    <p>These sentences were translated into Russian by Victoria Moiseeva and Polina Zyaparova.
    Thanks a lot for your help!</p>
