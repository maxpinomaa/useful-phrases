<p>
    Conversational connectors are explained well <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fluentczech/connectorstarterpack" target="_blank">at this website</a>.
    But in short, they are very useful because they make your sentences longer,
    and often more interesting.
    Also they give you more thinking time for the actual information you want to convey to the other person.
</p>
<!--
<p>
    After you have studied the conversational connectors below, you can test them <a href="{% url 'post_list29' %}">at this page</a>.
    The test doesn't have all of the connectors yet.

    <p>These sentences were translated into Spanish by Antuan√© Nieto, Rolando Wistuba Lorca, Elisa Wistuba Lorca and Silvia Verges.
    Thanks a lot for your help!</p>
